# Pizza_Classifier
This is a basic image classifier which distinguishes between a burnt pizza and a good one by uploading image from our device. A convolutional neural network model is developed on a jupyter notebook and the UI is built using html,css and javascript. The entire model is coded in python and and the data set on which the model is trained was also created by my own.
Some screenshots are available in this repository.
